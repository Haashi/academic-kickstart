This project was pretty straightforward. The use case is really poor, a lot of tools can do that, and better.


My goal was to try out a Cloud Provider and see by myself how "serverless" is relevant. I used Google Cloud for that project, I had no credits left on Amazon Web Services but could have used it as well.

Lasted about 2 days. I will not do a post about it, and I deleted the project on the Google Cloud platform 3 months after.

Technologies used for this project : 
- ReactJS
- TypeScript
- Firebase
- Google Cloud
