Mod for private server of the programming game [Screeps](https://screeps.com).

The mod allows to serve static welcome page for browser connections. Useful if you wanna show more informations than the basic 'Screeps is running on address:port'.

The mod was working 2 years ago, I do not know if it works anymore with newer versions. Written in NodeJS.
