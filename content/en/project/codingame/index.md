[Codingame](https://www.codingame.com) website hosts coding contests every 6 months. These contests requires you to write artificial intelligence to play extended versions of famous known games (Pacman, tic-tac-toe...). Your code is then played against all other players code and is ranked based on a trueskill algorithm.

As of today, I joined 3 contests and trained on many past contests.
My recent rankings are :
 - Spring Challenge 2020 (Pacman) 541st / 4955 players
 - Ocean of Code 173rd / 2279 players
 - Unleash the Geek 230th / 2162 players

I solve most contests using famous artifical intelligence algorithms, such as Monte Carlo Tree Search, Genetic algortihms, pathfinding algorithms.

Every contests is a blast and I'm looking forward to join another. You can have a look at my [profile](https://www.codingame.com/profile/eb9859d6b38622dfb9e50fa85da98e2f1945112) to see what type of problems I love solving.
